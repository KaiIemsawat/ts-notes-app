Notes App
Create a notes application.
This application would allow user to create their notes. However, they need to create an account first. Once they have an account, the users may add, edit, or delete their notes. Only those that the notes belong to may access and edit them. Each note contains Title and descriptions that users may input. Also, each notes contains timestamp that display the moment of creation or edit. This app is very responsive. It could be viewd in any screen sizes nicely
