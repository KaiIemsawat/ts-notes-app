## About

This is a part of my practice projects. The application allows users to register and login to see their own notes. The users will not be able to asscess everyone else's notes. The app is built with user friendly concept. So, it is very easy to access in any screen size.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `"npm start"`,

The app is built using `react` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser. You also need to run this command in both client and server directores using the same command, `npm start`, as well to completely run the app. This would launch `nodemon` and allow files on server side each time you update files. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build"`,

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!
